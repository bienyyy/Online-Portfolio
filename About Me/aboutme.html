        <p>Hi, I’m Bien Dranreb Gablines, the eldest son in the family and also the first grandchild. 
        I'm an introvert, but it depends on the bond I build with others. I don't really like heavy crowds, socializing, or interacting with people much because of how strict my grandmother was back then.
        This made me prefer being alone and occupying myself with what I have in my room.
        Right now, I’m a first-year college student taking up Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at University of Bohol. 
        My goal in life is to succeed in my field while also figuring out what <q>happiness</q> truly means to me.</p>

        <p>Growing up, I was always a curious kid, fascinated by how things worked. I love reading books, especially those that spark my interest, such as science-related books, drama, and manga, e.g., <cite>Demon Slayer</cite>.
        I also love solving problems and getting to the root of things because I believe everything happens for a reason. 
        My childhood wasn’t exactly easy, but I made the most of it, learned a lot along the way, and let those experiences shape who I am today.</p>

        <p>Now that I’m 18 years old, I focus on improving myself, learning from past mistakes, and gaining new life experiences.  
        I understood how cruel life can be at a young age, leading me to experience early depression. 
        I've struggled ever since, but it hasn't stopped me from becoming the person I am today and striving to be even better.
        One of my biggest passions is speedcubing, where I developed a deep interest in twisty puzzles.  
        I'm proud to be part of an amazing global community, where solving these puzzles feels like free therapy.  
        Meeting others who share the same passion is truly inspiring, especially knowing that it all started with the brilliant mind of Erno Rubik.</p>

        <p>Additionally, I enjoy playing <dfn>MOBA games</dfn> like <cite>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</cite> and <cite>Pokémon Unite</cite>.  
        I also love solving riddles, tricky puzzles, and anything that challenges my mind.  
        More importantly, I love helping people whenever I can, because even small acts of kindness can make <strong>a big difference.</strong></p>

        <h3>As Erno Rubik once said:</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "If you are curious, you'll find the puzzles around you. If you are determined, you will solve them."
        </blockquote>
		
		<h3>Some of My Poems</h3>

Abode

Home, a 4-letter word
with a simple meaning to it.
We can all say it's a place 
that we like to call "the safe place."

Some may say it's the people 
who make us feel at "home,"
others would say it's our family
who make us feel at "home."

But if you ask me, "Do I feel at home?"
Being confused and shocked, 
I can't really answer that
when I myself don't feel at HOME.

Cruel

silence too loud
don't you hear it, too?
within this body
there's chaos

why is that?
aren't we supposed to enjoy "life"
couldn't tell, but sooner or later
we will find out
going with the flow as always

people come and go
it takes time to get over them
eventually, you'll recover from it
don't forget who stayed

life has to many reasons 
to explore, to understand 
and mostly to enjoy
so let's discover what we call, "life"

        <!-- Poem 3 -->
        <div class="poem-heading" onclick="togglePoem('poem3')">Dark as Cold</div>
        <div id="poem3" class="poem-container">

Dark as Cold

A cold evening, 
laying down in my bed, a dark empty room 
glarring upon the sealings, seeing pitch darkness
couldn't help to think about how life was back then
come to think of it, sharing our problems to others 
was a waste of time, waste of energy

but the same time, i couldn't express how happy i was 
to let it all out, to have someone to "understand" or better to know your story
we just can't forget about our miserable life, the traumas, the incidents nor accidents, all of those things we just can't forget

so this is we call "life"?, as far as i know
everything has a plan, a reason why it happened
like this dark room with the coldness of the air 
brushes through my skin, gives shivers just like how life has been these years
can't help but to wonder, how would life been if those things never happened?
